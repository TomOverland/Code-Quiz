## Description
This application will allow you to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.  
Once you click the "start" button, a timer appears and you a presented with a question and four choices.  
When you answer a question, you are presented with another question.  
If you answer a question incorrectly, ten seconds are deducted from the clock.  
When all questions are answered, or if the clock reaches zero, then the quiz will end.
Once the quiz has ended, you can enter your initials to save your high scores!
